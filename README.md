# Hospital_Lengthofstay_R

## Introduction:
The healthcare landscape underwent a seismic shift with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, challenging healthcare systems worldwide. As the virus spread rapidly, it exposed vulnerabilities in resource allocation, highlighting the need for efficient patient care management. Hospitals faced unprecedented pressures, including the allocation of limited resources, such as ICU beds and medical staff. These constraints necessitated a reevaluation of patient care strategies, emphasizing optimization and resource allocation to ensure the best possible outcomes for every patient.

## Project Goal:
The primary objective is to develop and optimize predictive models that can accurately estimate a patient's length of stay upon admission. We have explored a range of statistical techniques, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Boosting, with the ultimate aim of identifying the best-performing model based on overall predictive performance.

 ## Significance of Predicting Length of Stay:
Predicting the length of stay for patients upon admission is not merely an academic exercise; it's a critical tool that can reshape the healthcare landscape in several profound ways:
* Resource Allocation: By accurately estimating how long a patient is likely to stay, hospitals can allocate resources more efficiently. This includes optimizing bed allocation, nursing staff schedules, and medical supply inventory management.
* Improved Patient Care: Predictive models enable healthcare providers to develop personalized care plans tailored to each patient's expected length of stay. This can enhance patient experience and outcomes.
* Cost Savings: Efficient resource allocation reduces unnecessary expenses, ultimately saving healthcare institutions and patients significant costs.
* COVID-19 and Beyond: While this project was inspired by the challenges posed by COVID-19, the insights gained from predicting length of stay are relevant beyond pandemics. They can enhance the resilience and responsiveness of healthcare systems in the face of various medical challenges.

## Dataset
The data used for this project has been obtained from the official website of the New York State government, specifically from the following link: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/82xm-y6g8. This dataset comprises more than one million records and encompasses 34 columns, presenting a complex and demanding data cleaning endeavor.
